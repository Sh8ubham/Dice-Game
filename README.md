# Dice-Game
Key Takeaways I had from this : 
Utilized DOM manipulation and JavaScript to create an interactive dice game.
Developed a website that randomly generates dice rolls for two players upon refresh.
Implemented logic to determine and announce the winner based on dice values.
Encouraged hands-on practice by providing starter code and options for building HTML and CSS from scratch.
